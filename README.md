# SQL To-Do List


## Description

With this project, I set out to make a to-do list application based on the technologies that we've covered in the past week. A user interface will be provided, which the user can use to add, review, edit, or delete tasks and items on the to-do list. Once the user has made an input or taken action in some way, information will be sent to our server, any logical comparisons or manipulations will take place, and then the results will be sent to the database where the data about the items on our list our 'actually' stored. The edited, updated, or retrieved data will then be packaged up by our server, and sent back to the client in order to update any changes that the user will need to see on the DOM.
